    <h1>Setting up your GitHub Pages</h1>>
    Hi everyone! So I setup my first github page today (August 25, 2021) and I'd like to share how it went.
    <br />
    1. I got interested in creating this so I went to Google and found this link: https://pages.github.com/ <br />
    2. So as instructed:(1)I created a repo with my username [username].github.io (2)I cloned it locally and created this first thing index.html <br />
    3. So add, commit, push this to my repo. <br />
    4. Then I accessed my GitHub Page URL : https://charmie.github.io <br />
    <br />
    Be very very very accurate in your username when creating your repository because it will not work if it's not exactly the same as your GitHub username. <br />
    In my case, my user name is <i><b>charmie</b></i> so my repo name is <i><br>charmie</i>.github.io<br />
    <br />
    I encountered a problem after doing the steps above. When I accessed my GitHub Page URL< it returnd me the 404 message.
    <br />
    If you encountered the same you can try this solution https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11577147/how-to-fix-http-404-on-github-pages. <br />
    In my case, a simple cache clearing worked. <br />
